# Automate the Functionality
This specific branch serves as an illustrative example of the process involved in converting manually performed test cases into automated ones. Although the methodology employed appears to be straightforward to understand on the surface, it does not guarantee consistent and reliable results upon execution, thus potentially reducing its overall reliability and trustworthiness.

Furthermore, tests that have been designed and developed without adherence to guiding principles or established standards may prove to be particularly difficult and complex to maintain in the long run. This complexity arises from the fact that these tests often have individual dependencies, making them more prone to errors and complications.

In addition to this, potential future changes to the code, whether minor or significant, could result in the production of duplicate code. This duplication not only inflates the size of the codebase unnecessarily but also makes it more difficult to manage and maintain.

The adopted method of automating manual user steps could also inadvertently result in the slowing down of these tests. This slowdown could have a detrimental impact on efficiency and productivity, negating the very benefits that automation is supposed to bring about.
