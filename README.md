Designing automation tests effectively is absolutely crucial for their success and ultimately, the success of your software development process.

Log in as `standard_user` or `visual_user`. Users can select items for checkout and, if necessary, remove or cancel the selected items. They can also add more items during the checkout process. However, they won't be able to complete the checkout without providing complete user information.

1. **Check out a random number of items.**
    
    Choose a random number of items, recording their name, price, and description. Verify these details in the cart. Proceed to the multi-step checkout, input user information, validate the overview, and confirm checkout to reach the completion page.
    
2. **Remove items from checkout.**
    
    Select a random number of items, noting down their names, prices, and descriptions. Cross-check these details in the cart. Finally, remove the items from checkout.
    
3. **Cancel the checkout.**
    
    Select random items, noting names, prices, and descriptions. Verify these in the cart. Proceed to multi-step checkout, input user information, but cancel instead of confirming. Ensure items remain in the cart.
    
4. **Add more items during checkout.**
    
    Select a random number of items, noting their name, price, and description. Confirm these details in the cart. Add additional items, then proceed to checkout. Enter the user information, verify the overview, and confirm the checkout process to arrive at the completion page.
    
5. **Cannot checkout without complete information.**
    
    Select random items, taking note of their names, prices, and descriptions. Then, confirm these items in the cart. Ensure that the user cannot proceed to checkout without providing all necessary information.
